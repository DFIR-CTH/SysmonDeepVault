# SysmonDeepVault

Hello Newbies and Experts,

As a passionate threat hunter, I've discovered through hands-on practice that Sysmon and its configurations are crucial tools. Sysmon acts as the narrator, telling the complete story of endpoint activity. In our technical environments, it captures every significant event on Windows endpoints, providing invaluable data for forensic analysis and incident response.

The repository **🔐 SysmonDeepVault** offers a complete overview, detailed workings of the config files, and practical detections enabled by custom configurations. Please explore these topics via the navigation links below.
